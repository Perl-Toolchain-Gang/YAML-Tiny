CONTRIBUTING

Thank you for considering contributing to this distribution.  This file
contains instructions that will help you work with the source code.

The distribution is managed with Dist::Zilla.  This means than many of the
usual files you might expect are not in the repository, but are generated
at release time (e.g. Makefile.PL).

However, you can run tests directly using the 'prove' tool:

  $ prove -l
  $ prove -lv t/some_test_file.t

For most distributions, 'prove' is entirely sufficent for you to test any
patches you have.

You may need to satisfy some dependencies.  See the included META.json
file for a list.  If you install App::mymeta_requires from CPAN, it's easy
to satisfy any that you are missing by piping the output to your favorite
CPAN client:

  $ mymeta-requires | cpanm
  $ cpan `mymeta-requires`

or if you use cpanminus, you can simply do:

  $ cpanm --installdeps .

Dist::Zilla is a very powerful authoring tool, but requires a number of
author-specific plugins.  If you would like to use it for contributing,
install it from CPAN, then run one of the following commands, depending on
your CPAN client:

  $ cpan `dzil authordeps`
  $ dzil authordeps | cpanm

Once installed, here are some dzil commands you might try:

  $ dzil build
  $ dzil test
  $ dzil xtest
