Revision history for YAML-Tiny

1.67      2015-05-12 00:10:24Z

        [FIXED]

        - instead of erroring on duplicate keys found in a hash (introduced in
          version 1.63), now we only warn. This fixes an issue in Strawberry Perl
          (via CPAN::Meta::YAML) when parsing a configuration file.

        [CHANGED]

        - Updated File::Temp test prereq to 0.19 for 'newdir'

1.66      2015-03-16 22:26:30Z

        [CHANGED]

        - removed bundled Test::TempDir::Tiny to rely on File::Temp
          for temporary directories during testing

1.65      2015-03-13 23:02:34Z

        [CHANGED]

        - artifacts left behind from testing are now cleaned up (GH#34)

1.64      2014-10-08 02:56:30Z

        [CHANGED]

        - remove silencing of any errors encountered while loading
          Scalar::Util (GH#33, Graham Knop)
        - now using JSON::MaybeXS in tests instead of JSON.pm

1.63      2014-06-11 21:58:18Z

        [FIXED]

        - incorrect error messages fixed, when $@ is clobbered when Carp
          wasn't loaded (GH#30, GH#31, Hilko Bengen)

        [CHANGED]

        - now checking for, and erroring on, duplicate keys found in a hash
          (GH#32, Hilko Bengen)

1.62      2014-03-16 12:28:44Z

        [FIXED]

        - fix handling of trailing colon in key name (RT#92916, H.Merijn
          Brand)

1.61      2014-02-24 16:59:49Z

        [FIXED]

        - fixed a test for VMS (RT#93297, Craig Berry)

1.60      2014-02-13 20:31:56Z

        - shipping 1.59 as stable, with no changes.

1.59      2014-02-06 03:10:35Z (TRIAL RELEASE)

        [CHANGED]

        - numeric values are now quoted whenever they've been used as a string
          (fixes inconsistent behaviour seen with numeric values, due to
          differences between the XS and pure-perl variants of Data::Dumper).
          (github issue #24)
        - numeric hash keys are now always quoted.

1.58      2014-02-04 18:01:58Z

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE]

        - 1.57 omitted a change entry for the following change:

        - Previously, YAML::Tiny was sloppy about file encodings.  It is
          now strict.  The 'read' method and 'LoadFile' function expect
          UTF-8 encoded files.  The 'write' method and 'DumpFile' function
          produce UTF-8 encoded files.  The 'read_string' and
          'write_string' methods and the 'Load' and 'Dump' functions
          expect or generate (decoded) character data.

1.57      2014-01-30 22:12:38Z

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE]

          - Previously, some errors would throw exceptions and some would
            return the error condition in $YAML::Tiny::errstr.  Now all
            errors throw exceptions.  Use of $errstr and the errstr method
            are deprecated. (David Golden)

        [FIXED]

          - Fixed write method to encode YAML file with UTF-8 (David Golden)
          - Improved SYNOPSIS and documentation of new (David Golden)

        [TESTING]

          - Tests have been cleaned up and reorganized.  Test coverage
            has been significnatly improved. (Ingy dÃ¶t Net, David Golden,
            Jim Keenan, Karen Etheridge)

1.56      2013-09-25 02:38:19Z
          - read_string documentation error fixed (RT#74409, thanks Tim Heaney!)
          - re-release with fixed compile test

1.55      2013-09-19 04:07:32Z
          - again packaging with ExtUtils::MakeMaker

1.54      2013-08-22 03:55:41Z
          - convert to Dist::Zilla
          - Updated format to conform to CPAN::Changes::Spec

1.53      2013-08-20
          - really fixed metadata

1.52      2013-08-20
          - updated repository metadata to reflect move to github

1.51      2012-03-11
          - The fix described in 1.48 was incorrect. Removing an additional
            if $@ to fix it properly.
          - Make the Scalar::Util version check resistant to bugs caused by
            development versions.

1.50      2011-06-23
          - Major bug fix, all code that writes arbitrary data should upgrade.
          - Simple scalars with no whitespace but ending in a colon like ABC: were
            not being quoted, which results in the parser confusing it with a
            mapping key and crashing.

1.49      2011-03-08
          - No functional changes.
          - Don't depend on the YAML modules in RELEASE_TESTING, as it can
            pollute the advisory META.yml.

1.48      2011-02-01
          - Fix to the refaddr compatibility where Scalar::Util is installed
            but is older than 1.18.

1.47      2011-01-31
          - No functional changes
          - Only depend on the YAML implementations when we are release testing

1.46      2010-12-16
          - No functional changes
          - Moving to a production release now CPAN Testers is green again

1.45_02   2010-12-07
          - Adding experimental support for exception->errstr conversion
          - Updating test suite yaml_error to not expect exceptions

1.45_01   2010-12-07
          - Added support for trailing line comments (INGY)
          - Added checks for some characters that are illegal or reserved
            in plain scalars (INGY)
          - Minor cleaning up of some out of date POD (ADAMK)
          - Updated AUTOMATED_TESTING dependencies to new versions (ADAMK)

1.44      2010-08-08
          - No functional changes, upgrading is not required
          - Minor tweaks to Makefile.PL
          - Minor cleanup around the refaddr emulation code

1.43      2010-07-10
          - No functional changes, upgrading is not required
          - Don't import Carp 'croak' any more, saving a few K

1.42      2010-06-25
          - No functional changes, upgrading is not required
          - Clarified documation to explain that YAML::Tiny escapes "bool"
            keywords when it writes them as strings so that YAML parsers in
            other languages won't get confused, but this does not mean that
            YAML::Tiny actually supports boolean types itself.
          - Added an extra test case for boolean keyword escaping.
          - YAML::Perl comparison tests were loading the file back in with
            YAML.pm by mistake. Corrected this and added an additional case
            that YAML::Perl doesn't support that I wasn't catching.
          - Author tests updated and moved into xt/
          - Updated the versions of the other YAML parsers we test ourselves
            against to the most recent versions of each.

1.41      2009-12-11
          - Fixes a performance bug reported by Apocalypse.
            Single line double-quoted strings longer than 32,000ish characters
            resulted in the regular expression engine crashing due to
            excessive recursion. Changed to a different regex that will most
            likely only crash after 32,000 ESCAPED characters. If I could use
            negative look-behind assertions (I can't because I need 5.004)
            this whole issue would be MUCH simpler to fix.

1.40      2009-07-31
          - Dear Ruby Community.
            Thank you so much for your bug report to the "Ruby Talk" mailing list
            regarding the lack of true/false support in Perl YAML modules.
            http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/169943
            This flaw has now been resolved, around 2 hours after we
            were made aware of it. Next time, we recommend you report these bugs
            to the people who can actually fix your problem.

1.39      2009-05-21
          - Even though utf8 starts at 5.7+ there's no is_utf till
            5.8.1 so skip in the tests if needed (ADAMK)

1.38      2009-05-16
          - Moving the test suite style closer to Parse::CPAN::Meta
